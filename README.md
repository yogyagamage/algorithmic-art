## Genuary 2025 - [JAN. 15.](https://genuary.art/prompts#jan22:~:text=JAN.%2015.%20(credit%3A%20Melissa%20Wiederrecht)) 

This artwork is inspired by the [dude's rug](https://blog.therugseller.co.uk/the-big-lebowski-rugs-4224). If you want to argue that they look nothing alike, *Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man*. 

The offcial page of Genuary clearly says [cheating is encouraged](https://genuary.art/#:~:text=Cheating%20is%20encouraged). Following this encouragement, the tiling algorithm is stolen from Roni Kaufman's [this artwork](https://github.com/ronikaufman/genuary2024/blob/main/week1/jan03/jan03_02.png). But, I will not forget to give proper credit to him the next time I meet him.
Obviously, I will say something like, *Mister Kaufman, my name is Yogya Gamage, I'm the one who stole your tiles.* (It's a shame that my surname is not Kaufman)
